### Objective
The objective of the game is to clear all the mines on the game grid without triggering any of them. The game grid consists of tiles, some of which contain mines. Each numbered tile indicates the number of mines in its neighboring cells.

### Modes
There are three difficulty modes: easy, medium, and hard. The difficulty level determines the size of the grid and the number of mines you must clear.

### How to play
To play, **left-click** (tap on mobile) to open a tile. To flag a potential mine, **right-click** (long-press on mobile). 

The timer will start to tick as soon as the first tile is opened. Players can challenge themselves to achieve faster completion times.
